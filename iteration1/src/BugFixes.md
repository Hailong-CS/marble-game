The whole project works pretty good, expect few bugs that beyond my hands.
- The collision between robot and obstacles. The reflect angle is not well calculated.
- Some collision between robot and the wall. The robot will bounceing around the wall when the incidence angel is too small and the speed is relative small.
- The base class of SensorTouch. I have successfully built the SensorBase class, however it doesn't fit well in the project.
- The win and lose window are not performed. The message will be shown on the terminal.
- The battery level is not window or number virtualized. You can tell the battery level by the color of changes on the robot.
